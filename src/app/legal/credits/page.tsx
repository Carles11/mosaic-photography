        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! IÂ´m a passionate developer who loves coding and creating useful
          tools and content. My name is Carles, the creator of
          mosaic.photography. This website is a labor of love, aimed at
          providing valuable resources and services for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintaining and improving this site takes a lot of time and effort,
          not to mention the costs associated with hosting and development.
          While I do not charge for any of the content or services here, your
          support would greatly help me keep this project alive and thriving.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find my work valuable and would like to support me, please
          consider buying me a coffee. Your donations will go directly towards
          covering the costs of running this site and enabling me to continue
          doing what I love.
        </p>
